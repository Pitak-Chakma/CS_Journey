Command Line 
- faster and more powerful way to maneuver inside OS compared to a GUI

OS File Structure 
- organizes their folders in a hierarchy, with parents and children, all relative to a base root directory. 

- root /
- absolute path = /user/pitak/target
- all terminals open in home directory ( ~ ) instead of root directory 

Some Important Commands 
- pwd = print working Directory

- cd = change directory  
	- cd Absolute path 
	- cd .. (Relative Path)(take me back one dir)
	- cd ~ = takes to home directory

- ls = list the contents of the directory 
	- ls -a = show all files including hidden ones
	- ls -l = provides longer format 
	- ls -al = combines the two 
	- ls folderName/ = to see what's inside these folders

- open fileName = opens that folder
- mkdir folderName = will create a new child directory inside the current directory 

- touch fileName.fileExtension = make a file in the current directory 
	- if file already exists then it will just update the last update time 

- mv fileName.Extention NewFileName.Extension = remane the file 

- mv fileName.Extension pathOfDestination = move that file 

- move pathOfTarget pathOfDestination = move the file to destination 

- rmdir folderName = deletes an empty folder

- rm fileName.Ext = deletes that file 

- rm -rf folderName = deletes directory (use very carefully, wont show warning while deleting impt folders)
