## Main Resoruces I will Follow 
- [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) 


## My 2 Cents
- I always wanted to learn how to code. after many half hazard attempts and studying just for exam,its time to truely enter into the world of python.  
- I got introduced to Python in my 1st year of University and decided to stick to it. 
- Wish me Best of Luck !!
